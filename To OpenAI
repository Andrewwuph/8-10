To OpenAI,
I’d like to briefly share what I’m working on.
The core of my work is helping people re-tag the emotional responses of the amygdala.
The amygdala marks daily experiences with emotional tags—these can come from other people’s opinions, fears, things we read online, or even subtle everyday situations. These tags influence our freedom and overall life experience.
My goal is to help people re-mark these emotional reactions, reducing their limiting effects and giving them greater choice.
At the same time, I work on turning neutral, emotionally unreactive daily experiences—like drinking tea or feeling the sun—into positive emotional tags, so that they can bring strength and happiness.
The overarching goal is to help individuals maximize their life experience in society and expand their range of choices.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond re-tagging the amygdala, another core focus is helping people understand their attention systems:

--CN (Central Executive Network)

--DMN (Default Mode Network)

These two networks compete for resources, and learning to consciously switch between them is vital.
Training this switching ability allows a person to convert excessive thought into execution power (DMN → CN).
The DMN itself is valuable—it’s not just about daydreaming:

--When making plans and simulating the future, the DMN can imagine different possibilities, reducing the sense of the unknown so the amygdala won’t overreact, making it easier to face real situations calmly.
--The DMN can also reduce unrealistic expectations: after setting a goal, one can simulate possible futures if the goal isn’t achieved, and map alternative paths forward. This lowers the risk of disappointment and the amygdala’s excessive reaction to it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For individuals in less stable mental states, their range of choices is often weak. They tend to overthink and sometimes need external help to make decisions.
Although this might not be seen as rigorous in a purely scientific context, I have found that tarot cards are a highly effective psychological tool.
I have also learned about a method called family constellation, which helps people understand the dynamics of their family relationships. From my experience, tarot cards can be applied in family constellation work and can also guide people toward a clearer direction in life.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future, I aim to combine multiple tools:

--Brain region analysis

--Tarot cards

--Brainwave frequency music

--Breath control

 …and more, to help people discover their innate talents, and to teach them how to think abstractly about life.

I want these methods to become capital for mastering one’s own life.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultimately, I hope to start from education:
Using AI to help people learn abstract thinking, fuel their learning through curiosity, better manage their emotions, take charge of their lives, and create possibilities—helping them find purpose and direction.

I believe that when people can help society while also feeling happiness themselves, we will solve many societal problems.
If this can be implemented through education, people will become more creative, and it will open a new era of human–AI co-creation.

This is the direction I’m working toward, and the future I believe we can build.
